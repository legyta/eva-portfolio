//         <p>
//           Having worked as a Psychotherapist/Counsellor for the last six years,
//           in an integrative/ person centered way has helped create core values,
//           putting clients at the center, in a target driven environment whatever
//           age the clients may be.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           Born and raised in Devon to psychotherapist parents, I followed in
//           their footsteps and started training from a young age towards my
//           passion, which is the never ending journey of discovering/
//           understanding what it is to be human for me and others, it has meant I
//           have an innate joy and curiosity for the ever evolving expression of
//           the diverse experience of being on this earth together.
//         </p>

//           I started out doing the level four diploma with CPTA in adult
//           integrative counselling, then on to the BACP registered BA in
//           Integrative counselling, while working for the NHS as a wellbeing
//           practitioner.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           The NHS being an extremely vital learning for me, as well as a
//           realization at the importance of giving more time, and sessions to
//           clients and space to the therapist to truly hold the client in mind. I
//           realised the importance of working with younger clients, due to the
//           amount of people struggling with messages they received in childhood.
//         </p>

//           This is when I started the MA in child and adolescent psychotherapy,
//           enabling children to acquire the tools within them that they will need
//           to meet the inevitable challengeâ€™s life brings. I also work with EFT
//           (emotional freedom technique) the concept of self-love which can
//           completely transform someone&#39;s self-perception. I am a believer in
//           re-programming how we think, and I believe compassion is the most
//           effective tool.

//           My career as a therapist is not just a career for me, but a life
//           choice. Meaning I am continually looking at my own states of
//           transference, noticing if I am communicating with honesty and respect
//           and continually striving for self-awareness.

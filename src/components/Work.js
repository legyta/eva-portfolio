//         <p>
//           I work within the BACP/UKCP Ethical Framework as a registered member
//           of the BACP/UKCP, specialising in working with children and
//           adolescence as an Integrative psychotherapist.

//           I offer long-term and short-term face-to-face and online sessions. Our
//           appointments are weekly, at the time we agree together. The
//           appointments last 50 minutes, these appointments are confidential and
//           led by You.

//         <h1>Therapeutic approach</h1>
//         <p>
//           As an integrative therapist, I integrate a lot of different modalities
//           into the work. This can take the form of a more physical grounded
//           expression of emotion, or we may work with letter writing and inner
//           child work. Primarily this is your space, and you can share what is
//           important to you right now, as now is all there really is.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           The past can dictate how we react to a brand-new situation in the
//           present, this is where empty chair work and narrative therapy is
//           useful. Sometimes when we start feeling “things” for the first time,
//           therapy can feel more painful, before we feel more free and able to
//           cope.
//         </p>
//         <div className="work-image">
//           <img src={cactus} alt="cactus" />
//         </div>
//         <p>
//           I am aware that sometimes we don’t want people to know we are in
//           therapy, and sometimes we just want one thing, that is private to us.
//           I am also aware this can change from day to day. Sometimes seeing a
//           therapist can remind us of emotions we don’t want to feel in that
//           moment. For this reason, my policy is that if I see you outside, I
//           won’t say “hello” unless you say hello to me.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           I believe that creativity, especially painting, clay work and
//           sand-tray give us direct access to the unconscious. Through these
//           mediums we can explore very painful topics safely and creatively.
//           Bringing in a third element to the work, which puts less pressure on
//           words, and having to speak to a complete stranger.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           Sometimes beliefs about ourselves are painful, or even damaging and we
//           have no idea how to change our internal self-critic. Working together
//           to challenge (with love) our decisions and our behaviours, can
//           transform patterns we thought defined us.
//         </p>

//         <p>
//           "Anxiety: when our body can't cope with the situation only happening
//           in our mind"{" "}
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           I believe that we are complete beings, and that everything works in a
//           synthesis. Which means that when we speak about thoughts, we can’t
//           forget the body and vice versa. So, when we speak about life, I also
//           leave the space for us to explore death. We are beings that have many
//           different aspects to us, I sometimes work with archetypes and often
//           explore with clients their feelings coming from different “parts” of
//           themselves.
//         </p>
//         <p>
//           There is an importance for us to sit in the bigger picture, so that we
//           can see more clearly, and sometimes we need to see our behaviour from
//           a distance. This can take the form of spiritual identity, which I feel
//           is an integral part of being human.
